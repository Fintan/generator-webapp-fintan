# Generator-webapp-fintan

A generator for Yeoman.

## Getting started
- Make sure you have [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) installed:
    `npm install -g yo`
- Install the generator: `npm install -g generator-webapp-fintan`
- Run: `yo webapp-fintan`

## What gets generated?

I have basically customised and simplified [Generator-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp) to suit my own needs.  I've taken out the bits I don't need and made adjustments to accommodate how I use require.js

## Todo

* Need to add Jasmine (or other testing framework) support
* Add handlebars support
* Add support for Sass
